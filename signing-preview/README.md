# signing-preview

Turns any wallet signing request into a human-readable preview before the user signs. It covers Ethereum, Arbitrum One, HyperEVM (chain 999) and Hyperliquid's native HyperCore actions, with special handling for Arbitrum → Hyperliquid deposits.

It takes a standard EIP-1193 request (`{ method, params }`), the same object every dApp sends to every wallet. It returns plain JSON that any wallet, extension or backend can render.

```
"Withdraw 50 USDC to Arbitrum"
Withdraws 50 USDC from Hyperliquid to your address on Arbitrum One (a 1 USDC fee is deducted).
  You receive on Arbitrum (approx.)   49 USDC
```

This project is self-contained. It shares no code with the research code elsewhere in this repository.

## Quickstart

Requires Node.js 22.18 or later, which runs TypeScript directly.

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm start
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8787. The demo is a mock dApp sending requests to a mock wallet that is wrapped with the interceptor. Every balance, price and account in the demo is **mock data** (see `mocks/data.ts`).

```bash
npm test
```

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

## Using it from any wallet or extension

There are three ways to integrate, all producing the same `Preview` JSON.

**1. HTTP API.** Works from anywhere: wallet backends, extensions, mobile apps.

```bash
curl -s localhost:8787/v1/preview -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{
  "request": { "method": "eth_sendTransaction", "params": [{ "from": "0xa11ce00000000000000000000000000000000001",
    "to": "0xaf88d065e77c8cc2239327c5edb3a432268e5831", "chainId": "0xa4b1",
    "data": "0xa9059cbb0000000000000000000000002df1c51e09aecf9cacb7bc98cb1742757f163df70000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005f5e100" }] },
  "context": { "account": "0xa11ce00000000000000000000000000000000001", "origin": "https://some.dapp" }
}'
```

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /v1/preview` | Body `{ request, context? }` returns a `Preview`. Malformed requests return `400 INVALID_REQUEST`. |
| `GET /v1/health` | Liveness check. |
| `GET /v1/samples` | The demo's mock requests. |

CORS defaults to `*`, so pages, extensions (`chrome-extension://…`) and apps can all call it. Set `CORS_ORIGIN` to restrict it. The API never signs anything. Its outbound calls go only to the RPC and Hyperliquid URLs configured on the server; callers can't supply URLs.

**2. EIP-1193 interceptor (browser, no dependencies).** Wrap whichever provider you have: `window.ethereum`, an EIP-6963 provider, or a WalletConnect provider. Every signing request is previewed, and the request is only forwarded to the wallet if `confirm` resolves `true`. A rejection throws the standard EIP-1193 `4001` error, and other methods pass through untouched.

```js
import { withSigningPreview, remotePreview } from './dist/interceptor.js';

const provider = withSigningPreview(window.ethereum, {
  preview: remotePreview('https://your-host/v1/preview'),
  confirm: async (preview) => showMyDialog(preview),   // resolve true to sign
});
// Hand `provider` to viem/ethers/wagmi as usual.
```

The interceptor fills in `chainId` and `account` with the non-prompting `eth_chainId` and `eth_accounts` calls. If the preview service fails, `confirm` still receives an explicit "Preview unavailable" preview; the request is never forwarded silently.

**3. In-process library.** For a wallet or extension that runs the previewer locally, without the API (`dist/signing-preview.js` is a browser bundle of the same code):

```ts
import { previewRequest, StaticTokenRegistry, HttpHyperliquidInfo, RpcSimulator } from 'signing-preview';

const preview = await previewRequest(request, { chainId: 42161, account, origin }, {
  tokens: new StaticTokenRegistry(),
  hyperliquid: { mainnet: new HttpHyperliquidInfo() },
  simulator: new RpcSimulator({ 1: ETH_RPC, 42161: ARB_RPC }),   // optional
});
```

`npm run build` produces `dist/interceptor.js` and `dist/signing-preview.js`.

## What is decoded

| Flow | Request | Shown |
|---|---|---|
| Arbitrum → Hyperliquid, **Bridge2** | USDC `transfer` to `0x2df1…3df7` | Deposit amount and the credited Hyperliquid account. **Danger** below 5 USDC (funds lost), for a non-USDC token, or on the wrong chain. |
| Arbitrum → HyperCore, **Circle CCTP** (Circle's guide) | 1. `ReceiveWithAuthorization` signature on USDC; 2. `CctpExtension.batchDepositForBurnWithAuth` | Amount, batch split, HyperCore recipient, perps/spot, fee cap, guaranteed minimum and expected credit (0.20 USDC forwarding fee). **Danger** for every mistake that leaves funds stuck (see [Circle CCTP accuracy](#circle-cctp-accuracy)). |
| Ethereum/Arbitrum → HyperCore, **CCTP V2** | `TokenMessengerV2.depositForBurnWithHook` / `depositForBurn` | Same checks; plain CCTP transfers to any other domain are decoded too. Mainnets plus Ethereum Sepolia and Arbitrum Sepolia (→ HyperEVM testnet). |
| Sponsored HyperCore deposits | `ReceiveWithAuthorization` to `CctpExtensionV2` | Recognised, with a caution that the recipient is bound into the nonce and can't be shown. |
| USDC gasless transfers | EIP-3009 `TransferWithAuthorization` / `ReceiveWithAuthorization` / `CancelAuthorization` | Amount, spender/recipient, validity window; warns that a transfer authorization works like sending the payment. |
| HyperCore **user-signed** actions | `eth_signTypedData_v4`, `HyperliquidSignTransaction` domain | `Withdraw` (net of the 1 USDC fee), `UsdSend`, `SpotSend` (including HyperCore → HyperEVM via system address), `UsdClassTransfer`, `ApproveAgent`, `ApproveBuilderFee`, `TokenDelegate`, `CDeposit`/`CWithdraw`, `SendAsset`, `ConvertToMultiSigUser`, `SendMultiSig`; unknown types list every field. Checks: imitation domains, testnet, expired or future timestamps, a token ID that doesn't match its label. |
| HyperCore **L1** actions | `Agent { source, connectionId }`, `Exchange` domain | Orders (limit, trigger TP/SL, builder fee), cancels, modify, leverage, isolated margin, TWAP, vault/sub-account transfers, and more, **when the original action is supplied** (see below). Adds mid-price and margin context from `/info`. |
| HyperEVM → HyperCore | CoreWriter `sendRawAction` | All CoreWriter actions (IDs 1–13, 15, 16), with 1e8 price/size scaling. Notes that HyperCore runs the action asynchronously, so a failure there doesn't revert the EVM transaction. |
| HyperEVM → HyperCore | HYPE to `0x2222…`, ERC-20 to `0x20…<index>` | "Move X to HyperCore". **Danger** if the token isn't the contract linked to that index. |
| Ethereum / Arbitrum / HyperEVM | ERC-20 transfer/approve/transferFrom, `setApprovalForAll`, WETH, Permit2 `approve`, native sends, contract creation | Amounts with the token's symbol and decimals. Warns on unlimited approvals, zero-value transfers and transfers to the token contract itself. |
| Off-chain approvals | ERC-2612 / DAI `Permit`, Permit2 `PermitSingle/Batch/TransferFrom` | Spender, amount and expiry; flags unlimited or long-lived permissions and owner mismatches. |
| Messages | `personal_sign`, SIWE, `eth_sign` | Readable text; SIWE domain vs. requesting origin (phishing); `eth_sign` is always danger. |
| Batches | `wallet_sendCalls` (EIP-5792) | Each call previewed, with warnings merged. |
| Anything else | unknown calldata | `opaque`, with the selector shown. Simulated balance changes are added when a simulator is configured. |

### Hyperliquid L1 actions: the one real limit

For orders, cancels and leverage changes, the wallet only signs the hash of the action. **No previewer can recover the action from the signing request alone.** The Hyperliquid web app avoids wallet prompts for these by approving a local agent key once (`ApproveAgent`, fully decoded here). So when one of these hashes reaches the user's main wallet, the default preview says the contents are hidden and advises caution.

A dApp or integrator that holds the action can pass it as `context.hyperliquid = { action, nonce, vaultAddress?, expiresAfter? }`. The previewer re-hashes it and decodes it **only if** the hash equals the signed `connectionId`. Otherwise it reports a **danger** mismatch.

## Preview JSON

```ts
{
  schema: 'signing-preview/1',
  method, kind: 'transaction' | 'batch' | 'typed_data' | 'message' | 'unsupported',
  network: { kind: 'evm', chainId, name } | { kind: 'hypercore', name, testnet } | null,
  title, summary,                       // plain-language headline and sentence
  details: [{ label, value, raw? }],    // raw = exact integer/hex when value is formatted
  assetChanges: [{ direction, account, amount, symbol, raw?, asset?, basis }],
  warnings: [{ severity: 'info' | 'caution' | 'danger', code, message }],
  attention: 'none' | 'info' | 'caution' | 'danger',   // display hint, not a security verdict
  decoding: { status: 'full' | 'partial' | 'opaque', decoder, notes },
  simulation?: { status, source, gasUsed?, revertReason? },
  calls?: Preview[],                    // batches
}
```

`assetChanges[].basis` says where each number comes from:
- `requested`: what the signed request asks for.
- `simulated_events`: transfer events from `eth_simulateV1`.

Neither is a measured final balance. Fee-on-transfer or rebasing tokens, and state changes before inclusion, can differ.

## Mock and live data

`npm start` uses mock data. To use real data:

```bash
SIGNING_PREVIEW_MODE=live ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=… ARBITRUM_RPC_URL=… HYPEREVM_RPC_URL=… npm start
```

Live mode reads Hyperliquid's public `/info` API and simulates with `eth_simulateV1` on any chain that has an RPC URL configured. Chains without one are previewed from the decoded request only. **Live mode has not been exercised against real endpoints yet.** Its RPC and `/info` clients are covered by tests with stubbed responses only.

## What was verified, and what wasn't

- **L1 action hashing** matches vectors generated by the official `hyperliquid-python-sdk` 0.24.0 (`test/fixtures/l1-action-hashes.json`). That covers plain, vault and `expiresAfter` cases. User-signed type layouts were checked against the same SDK.
- **CoreWriter** action IDs, field types, TIF codes and system-address formats were checked against `hyperliquid-dev/hyper-evm-lib` (`HLConstants.sol`, `CoreWriterLib.sol`).
- **Not independently verified:**
  - The units for CoreWriter USD amounts (1e6) and builder-fee rates are assumptions.
  - `CDeposit`/`CWithdraw` field names, the Bridge2 5 USDC minimum and the 1 USDC withdrawal fee follow Hyperliquid's documentation, but weren't re-checked here because the docs site isn't reachable from the environment this was built in.

  Confirm all of these against current official docs before relying on them.
- The known-token list is short (`src/chains.ts`). Unknown tokens are shown in base units with a warning. Add a token list or on-chain `symbol()`/`decimals()` lookups through the `TokenRegistry` interface.
- There is no threat-intelligence feed. Warnings are rule-based observations, and `attention: 'none'` doesn't mean "safe".

## Circle CCTP accuracy

The CCTP decoder mirrors Circle's own contracts rather than only the docs:
- `circlefin/hyperevm-circle-contracts` @ `ffcc978` (`CctpExtension`, `CctpForwarder`, `CctpForwarderHookData`, `CoreDepositWallet`). This was still the latest commit on 2026-11-03.
- `circlefin/evm-cctp-contracts` @ `a92a2b4` (`TokenMessengerV2`).

Addresses and fees come from Circle's docs (snapshot of 2026-10-29, saved under `research/arbitrum-deposit-v1/sources/docs`).

`test/circle-docs.test.ts` rebuilds the transactions in Circle's Arbitrum → HyperCore guide. It copies the guide's hook encoder and ABI verbatim and signs with a throwaway key, on Arbitrum Sepolia as written and on mainnet. It also covers the Ethereum guide's fee example.

What the contracts imply, and what the preview reports:
- **Funds stuck (danger).** Any of these makes `CctpForwarder.mintAndForward` or `CoreDepositWallet.depositFor` revert:
  - hook missing, shorter than 52 bytes, or not version 0 (this includes the guide's "no recipient" header-only hook and the Forwarding Service's version-1 format)
  - `mintRecipient` or `destinationCaller` not the forwarder, or the other network's forwarder
  - recipient is zero, HyperEVM USDC, `CoreDepositWallet` or the USDC system address

  Only the forwarder may complete these messages, so the burned USDC is never credited.
- **Source-chain revert (caution).** Gas is lost, but the USDC stays in the wallet:
  - `maxFee ≥ amount`
  - amount 0
  - empty hook on `depositForBurnWithHook`
  - `CctpExtension` total not a multiple of the batch size
  - expired authorization
- **Fees.** Credit is at least `amount − maxFee`. The CCTP contracts enforce this.
  - Arbitrum: the expected credit is `amount − 0.20` USDC. There is no fast-transfer fee, just the forwarding fee. Circle's example: 10 USDC → 9.80.
  - Ethereum: about `amount − (1 bp + 0.20 USDC + gas)`.
  - A `maxFee` below the documented fee gets a caution: automatic delivery isn't guaranteed. `mintAndForward` is callable by anyone with the attestation, so the transfer can still be completed manually.
- **Routing.**
  - A hook of 52–55 bytes routes to perps.
  - DEX IDs other than perps and spot fall back to the recipient's spot balance unless Circle has enabled them.
  - Magic bytes and the length field are ignored on-chain (noted, not flagged).
- **Docs vs contract.** Circle's concept page says "there is no minimum deposit amount" and that the 1 USDC activation fee is charged later. But `CoreDepositWallet._sendAsset` (perps route only) deducts a configurable `newCoreAccountFee` for recipients without a HyperCore account, and reverts if the deposit doesn't exceed it. That would leave the funds stuck. The preview cautions on small perps deposits; spot deposits are unaffected.

Not checked, because they need live chain state: the recipient blacklist, the live `newCoreAccountFee` value, which extra DEXes are enabled, whether the recipient already exists on HyperCore, and whether the deployed bytecode matches this source.

## Layout

```
src/preview.ts            entry point: routes EIP-1193 methods
src/evm/                  transaction decoders (Bridge2, CCTP, CoreWriter, system transfers, ERC-20)
src/typed-data/           EIP-712: Hyperliquid user-signed + L1, Permit/Permit2, generic
src/hyperliquid/          /info client, asset resolution, L1 action hash
src/simulation.ts         eth_simulateV1 simulator + mock
src/interceptor.ts        dependency-free EIP-1193 wrapper
src/server.ts             HTTP API + demo server
mocks/data.ts             mock market/account data and sample requests
demo/                     demo dApp + wallet UI
```

Each decoder is a function `(tx, env) => Decoded | null`. To add one, insert it into `ADAPTERS` in `src/evm/transaction.ts` (or `TYPED_DATA_ADAPTERS` in `src/preview.ts`) before the generic fallbacks.
